     describes the relation between Predecessor and Successor. One node can potentially succeed/replace many others.
     This can be use in two ways:
     Either do define some temporal order of things.
     Or to define some dependency of actions to be done.
     The application managing such dependency graphs is responsible to prevent cyclic dependencies.
