    description: "Defineds the time when something was actually reported.\rThe values\
      \ can combin date and time with time zone designator according to ISO 8601.\r\
      Reported time is used in incident management in the following manner: in most\
      \ cases the reported time equals the time when the incident is created. In some\
      \ cases, e.g. the incident is created after the helpdesk has already worked\
      \ on some request before it was decided to create an incident, the reported\
      \ time might differ from ticket creation/opening time."
