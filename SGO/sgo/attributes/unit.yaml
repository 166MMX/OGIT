      defines a unit of measure according to http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html
      we encourage to use the curly braces syntax to specify unit annotations, 
      especially when dealing with non-units (like counters)
      if the values are non-numeric, which is not covered by the referenced
      stanard, we suggest to use the annotation {STRING}
