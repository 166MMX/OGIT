## What to contribute

The requests fall into two base categories:
* request to extend SGO
* request to add/modify the NTO "enablement"

Here a list of typical requests:

| Request type ID | scope | request content |
| --------------: | :---: | --------------- |
| I a             | SGO   | add some attribute to an existing SGO "entity" |
| I b             | SGO   | add a new "entity" with SGO scope (i.e. no NTO schema available or referenced) |
| II a            | n/a   | add a new "verb" |
| II b            | n/a   | add a new "allowed" stanza to an existing "verb" (i.e. extend applicability of a "verb" |
| III a           | NTO   | add some attribute to an existing NTO "entity" |
| III b           | NTO   | add a new "entity" with NTO scope |
| III c           | NTO   | add/update a "schema" entry |

In most cases a contribution will consist of several such requests.
