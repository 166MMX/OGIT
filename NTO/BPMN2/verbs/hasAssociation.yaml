    description: |
      An Association is represented with a dotted line. It is used to associate an Artifact or text to a Flow Object, and can 
      indicate some directionality using an open arrowhead (toward the artifact to represent a result, from the artifact to 
      represent an input, and both to indicate it is read and updated). No directionality is used when the Artifact or text is 
      associated with a sequence or message flow (as that flow already shows the direction).
