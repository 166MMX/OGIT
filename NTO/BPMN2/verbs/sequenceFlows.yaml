    description: |
      A sequence flow is the connector between two elements of a process. After an element is visited during process execution, 
      all outgoing sequence flows will be followed. This means that the default nature of BPMN 2.0 is to be parallel: 
      two outgoing sequence flows will create two separate, parallel paths of execution.
