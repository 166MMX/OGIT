      BPMN provides us with the subprocess to help with the expanding/collapsing view. A subprocess describes a detailed 
      sequence, but it takes no more space in the diagram of the parent process than does a task. Both tasks and subprocesses 
      are part of the activities class and are therefore represented as rectangles with rounded corners. The only difference 
      is the plus sign, indicating a stored detailed sequence for the subprocess.
