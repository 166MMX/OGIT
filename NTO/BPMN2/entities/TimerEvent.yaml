      The timer event is often used when working with BPMN because it is so flexible to apply. A clock icon represents the timer event.
      Time moves on no matter what we or our processes do, so timer events can exist only as catching starts or intermediate events.
      You can model countdown times with an attached timer event. They are used this way frequently. You can specify upper time limits - the maximum time allowed for a processing task -
