    description: |
      Service tasks are those done by software. These are program functions applied automatically as a process executes. BPMN normally assumes that this function is provided as web service,
      though it can be another implementation. The service task is a component of process-oriented implementation integration, which explains why it is so similar in concept to Service-Oriented
      Architecture (SOA). Typical examples from the world of implementation integration are: The credit rating provided by a rating agency, obtained as XML through HTTP during a credit check;
      ooking an invoice received as EDIFACT through X.400 in SAP R/3;
      The offer of substandard goods by an online auction house, as a web service.
