      Do your processes run completely error-free? If not, you can identify potential errors in your models as a step toward 
      eliminating them, or as part of modeling escalation processes. In BPMN, error events are represented by a flash symbol.
      The BPMN specification does not specify what an error may be. As the modeler, you have to decide that.
      An error is a serious event in BPMN, so if catching, it can be modeled only as an attached intermediate event. 
      This means that an error during task execution must be handled in a specific way: As a throwing event, it can be modeled 
      only at the end of a process path so that the participant knows the process has failed. The parent process should likewise 
      recognize the failure.
