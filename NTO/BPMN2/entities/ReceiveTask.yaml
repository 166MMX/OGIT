    description: |
      A Message for the MessageRef attribute MUST be entered. This indicates that the Message will be received by the Task. The Message in this context is equivalent to an in-only message pattern (Web service). One or more corresponding incoming Message Flow MAY be shown on the diagram. However, the display of the Message Flow is not required. The Message is applied to all incoming Message Flow, but can arrive for only one of the incoming Message Flow for a single instance of the Task.
