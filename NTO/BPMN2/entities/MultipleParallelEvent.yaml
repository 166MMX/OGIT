    description: |
      The parallel event was added in BPMN 2.0 to supplement the multiple event. While a catching multiple event has XOR 
      semantics - it occurs as soon as one of its contained events occurs - the parallel event uses AND semantics. It doesn't 
      occur until all of its contained events occur. Because the throwing multiple event already implies AND semantics, the 
      specification defines parallel events as catching events only.
