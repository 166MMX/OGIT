    description: |
      An Event is represented with a circle and denotes something that happens (compared with an activity, which is something that 
      is done). Icons within the circle denote the type of event (e.g., an envelope representing a message, or a clock representing 
      time). Events are also classified as Catching (for example, if catching an incoming message starts a process) or Throwing 
      (such as throwing a completion message when a process ends).
