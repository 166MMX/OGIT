      A software node represents software entities residing on one or more hardware nodes. 
      A group of identical software entities with the same attributes (e. g. version, configuration) 
      are counting as one software node. This is crucial when modeling redundant or load balanced configurations.
      Example: A database service residing on a master and a slave server.
