    name: MARSModel
    description: |
      a collection of MARSNodes
      allows to address all MARS nodes belonging together in a certain way at once
      the relationship from MARSModel to MARSNode is 'ogit/has'
      examples are: all MARS nodes describing the IT of one data center, or all MARS nodes associated with the same contract. 
      In such cases you would connect the other entity (data center, contract) with the MARSModel node instead creating links to any MARSNode being part of that model
