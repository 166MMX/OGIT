    description: |
      The cost element is a type of cost for an activity, an ordered service or a business unit or budget. There are 3 levels of cost elements: Top Level, Middle Level, Bottom Level. Between the different levels, for each cost element there could be two types of edges: Incoming and Outgoing. Each type of edge could have two types of connections: consistsOf and contributesTo. E.g. a cost element CPU consists in 30% of a HR cost element. The HR cost element contributes in 40% to the cost of the CPU cost element. This percentage values will then be saved in the entity Distribution, which will be connected to the cost element
