    description: "The Monitoring-Automation Interface Description (MAID) is an abstract\
      \ definition of\\n\\n\r\\b 1. a timeseries to be monitored\\n\r\\b 2. desired\
      \ normalizations of that timeseries\\n\r\\b 3. a set of condition->event mappings\
      \ to apply to the timeseries or its normalizations\\n\\n\rThese time series\
      \ definitions can be parameterized for more flexibility. Usually each MAID should\
      \ describe \rexactly one raw timeseries. Depending of the type of monitoring\
      \ or event management system connected to \rthe engine, the corresponding adapter\
      \ may choose to either supply the raw timeseries itself or directly \rcreate\
      \ issues using the contained Event structures if it the raw data is not available.\\\
      n\\n\rThe abstract MAID definitions are then mapped to the MARS model within\
      \ the engine using so-called \"Binding Blocks\".\\n\\n\rThus MAID ensures that\
      \ the arago Automation Engine is compatible to any monitoring system and can\
      \ fully interact \rwith them. By formalizing the interface the information verification\
      \ process and definition of required add-ons \rto the monitoring systems becomes\
      \ possible."
