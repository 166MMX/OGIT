    description: "IT Objects will be representated in MARS Modell with MARS nodes.\
      \ \rThe MARS model builds upon four basic types of objects with a single type\
      \ of relationship. Basically the objects \rwhich are in fact called _��_��nodes_�\
      �_Ν represent both views - the business perspective and the technical view.\
      \ \rThe technical components are modeled in the machine and software layers\
      \ while the application and resource layers \rdescribe the business view of\
      \ the IT environment."
