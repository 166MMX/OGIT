    description: "Dynamic information exists within an automation engine in the form\
      \ of Issues otherwise referred to as \rTask or Situational Data. From the technical\
      \ perspective an Issue is a number of attributes (Key/Value tuples) with \r\
      unique names. From the logical point of view Issues contain information about\
      \ the change of states on a system. \rIssues can be injected into an automation\
      \ engine from external systems e.g. Monitoring or result from the execution\
      \ of a Knowledge Item. \rBy comparing an Issue with the Issue Condition of a\
      \ Knowledge Item an automation engine decides which Knowledge Items are are\
      \ processed \rin which order. If multiple Knowledge Items can be applied to\
      \ an Issue the KI with the more precisely defined \rIssueCondition is processed\
      \ first."
