      A collection of MARSNodes allows to address all MARS nodes belonging together in a certain way at once the relationship 
      from MARSModel to MARSNode is 'ogit/contains'.
      examples are: All MARS nodes describing the IT of one data center, or all MARS nodes associated with the same contract. 
      In such cases you would connect the other entity (data center, contract) with the MARSModel node instead creating links 
      to any MARSNode being part of that model.
