  RPA stands for Robotic process automation. 
  It is an emerging form of business process automation technology based on the notion of software robots or artificial intelligence (AI) workers.[1]
  It is an application of technology, governed by business logic and structured inputs, aimed at automating business processes. Using RPA tools, a company can configure software, or a “robot,” to capture and interpret applications for processing a transaction, manipulating data, triggering responses and communicating with other digital systems. RPA scenarios range from something as simple as generating an automatic response to an email to deploying thousands of bots, each programmed to automate jobs in an ERP system.
