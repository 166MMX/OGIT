      IT Service Management Ontology (ITSMO) is a powerful vocabulary for describing all of the detail of IT Services 
      in a way friendly to search engines, inventory applications, and browser extensions.\n
      ITSMO is for everyone that wants to describe or publish an IT Service Catalog according with ITIL best practices, 
      ISO 20000 standards and LinkedData W3C principles.\n
      By adding few extra tags to your service description, you make sure that potential customers realize all the 
      benefits of doing business with you, because their computers can find, explore and present your IT Service 
      Catalog with ease.\n
      ITSMO it is based on open Semantic Web technologies; this enable computers to help you in managing IT service 
      architectures: you can use semantic web tools to show the hidden dependency between services and between their 
      components (processes, documents, software, hardware, people, etc.).\n
      ITSMO is tolerant with incomplete, missing and even wrong data. It helps you to get the best from what you have, 
      helping you to manage risks and allowing to incrementally increase the quality of your data. It works with any 
      mix of structured and unstructured data source, from expensive repository tools (CMDB) to uncontrolled sparse files.\n
      ITSMO is free, easy to extend and works together with other public vocabularies, like Dublin Core, GoodRelations, 
      FOAF and with the forthcoming USDL to provide you a complete semantic framework for IT Service Providing business.
