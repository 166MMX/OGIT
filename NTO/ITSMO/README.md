Here you'll find the NTO enablement for ITSMO - ITSM Ontology V1

##ITSMO Background

IT Service Management Ontology (ITSMO) is a powerful vocabulary for describing all of the detail of IT Services in a way friendly to search engines, inventory applications, and browser extensions.

ITSMO is for everyone that wants to describe or publish an IT Service Catalog according with ITIL best practices, ISO 20000 standards and LinkedData W3C principles.

By adding few extra tags to your service description, you make sure that potential customers realize all the benefits of doing business with you, because their computers can find, explore and present your IT Service Catalog with ease.

ITSMO it is based on open Semantic Web technologies; this enable computers to help you in managing IT service architectures: you can use semantic web tools to show the hidden dependency between services and between their components (processes, documents, software, hardware, people, etc.).

ITSMO is tolerant with incomplete, missing and even wrong data. It helps you to get the best from what you have, helping you to manage risks and allowing to incrementally increase the quality of your data. It works with any mix of structured and unstructured data source, from expensive repository tools (CMDB) to uncontrolled sparse files.

ITSMO is free, easy to extend and works together with other public vocabularies, like Dublin Core, GoodRelations, FOAF and with the forthcoming USDL to provide you a complete semantic framework for IT Service Providing business.

## Schema

IT Service Management Ontology (ITSMO) is a standardized vocabulary (also known as "schema", "data dictionary", 
or "ontology") for annotating IT Services. ITSMO tries to be consistent with ITILÂ® v3 glossary (2011 edition) 
and its semantics. The whole syntax can found under http://ontology.it/itsmo/v1/itsmo.owl.
