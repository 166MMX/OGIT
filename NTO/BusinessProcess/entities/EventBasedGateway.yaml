    description: "The event-based Gateway allows you to make a decision based on events.\
      \ Each outgoing sequence flow of the gateway needs \rto be connected to an intermediate\
      \ catching event. When process execution reaches an event-based Gateway, the\
      \ gateway \racts like a wait state: execution is suspended. In addition, for\
      \ each outgoing sequence flow, an event subscription is \rcreated.\\n\rNote\
      \ the sequence flows running out of an event-based Gateway are different than\
      \ ordinary sequence flows. These sequence \rflows are never actually \"executed\"\
      . On the contrary, they allow the process engine to determine which events an\
      \ execution \rarriving at an event-based Gateway needs to subscribe to. The\
      \ following restrictions apply:\\n\rAn event-based Gateway must have two or\
      \ more outgoing sequence flows.\\n\rAn event-based Gateway may only be connected\
      \ to elements of the type intermediateCatchEvent. (Receive Tasks after an \r\
      event-based Gateway are not supported by the engine yet.)\\n\rAn intermediateCatchEvent\
      \ connected to an event-based Gateway must have a single incoming sequence flow."
