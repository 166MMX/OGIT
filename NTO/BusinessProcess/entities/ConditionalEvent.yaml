    description: |
      Entity to store a condition event, which will determine wether a process should start or continue. Anything can be a condition, and 
      conditions are independent of processes, which is why the condition (like the timer event) can only exist as a catching 
      event. A process cannot therefore conditional event trigger a conditional event.
