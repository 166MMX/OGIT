    description: "Entity to store a condition event, which will determine wether a\
      \ process should start or continue. Anything can be a condition, and \rconditions\
      \ are independent of processes, which is why the condition (like the timer event)\
      \ can only exist as a catching \revent. A process cannot therefore conditional\
      \ event trigger a conditional event."
