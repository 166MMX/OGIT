    description: "Gateways can be used to model concurrency in a process. The most\
      \ straightforward gateway to introduce concurrency \rin a process model is the\
      \ Parallel Gateway, which allows forking into multiple paths of execution or\
      \ joining multiple \rincoming paths of execution.\\n\rThe functionality of the\
      \ parallel gateway is based on the incoming and outgoing sequence flow(s):\\\
      n\rfork: all outgoing sequence flows are followed in parallel, creating one\
      \ concurrent execution for each sequence flow.\rjoin: all concurrent executions\
      \ arriving at the parallel gateway wait at the gateway until an execution has\
      \ arrived \rfor each of the incoming sequence flows. Then the process continues\
      \ past the joining gateway.\\n\rNote that a parallel gateway can have both fork\
      \ and join behaviors, if there are multiple incoming and outgoing \rsequence\
      \ flows for the same parallel gateway. In that case, the gateway will first\
      \ join all incoming sequence flows, \rbefore splitting into multiple concurrent\
      \ paths of executions.\\n\rAn important difference with other gateway types\
      \ is that the parallel gateway does not evaluate conditions. If conditions \r\
      are defined on the sequence flow connected with the parallel gateway, they are\
      \ simply ignored."
