    description: "Entitiy to store potential process errors as a step toward \reliminating\
      \ them, or as part of modeling escalation processes. In BPMN, error events are\
      \ represented by a flash symbol.\rThe BPMN specification does not specify what\
      \ an error may be, the modeler has to decide that.\rAn error is a serious event\
      \ in BPMN, so if catching, it can be modeled only as an attached intermediate\
      \ event. \rThis means that an error during task execution must be handled in\
      \ a specific way: As a throwing event, it can be modeled \ronly at the end of\
      \ a process path so that the participant knows the process has failed. The parent\
      \ process should likewise \rrecognize the failure."
