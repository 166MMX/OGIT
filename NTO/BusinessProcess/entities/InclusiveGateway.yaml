    description: "The Inclusive Gateway can be seen as a combination of an exclusive\
      \ and a parallel gateway. \rLike an exclusive gateway you can define conditions\
      \ on outgoing sequence flows and the inclusive gateway will evaluate them. \r\
      However, the main difference is that the inclusive gateway can receive more\
      \ than one sequence flow, like a parallel gateway.\rThe functionality of the\
      \ inclusive gateway is based on the incoming and outgoing sequence flow:\\n\\\
      n\rfork: all outgoing sequence flow conditions are evaluated and for the sequence\
      \ flow conditions that evaluate to 'true' the \rflows are followed in parallel,\
      \ creating one concurrent execution for each sequence flow.\\n\rjoin: all concurrent\
      \ executions arriving at the inclusive gateway wait at the gateway until an\
      \ execution has arrived for\reach of the incoming sequence flows that have a\
      \ process token. This is an important difference to the parallel gateway. \r\
      So in other words, the inclusive gateway will only wait for the incoming sequence\
      \ flows that will be executed. After the \rjoin, the process continues past\
      \ the joining inclusive gateway.\\n\rNote that an inclusive gateway can have\
      \ both fork and join behavior, if there are multiple incoming and outgoing sequence\
      \ \rflows for the same inclusive gateway. In that case, the gateway will first\
      \ join all incoming sequence flows that have a \rprocess token, before splitting\
      \ into multiple concurrent paths of executions for the outgoing sequence flows\
      \ that have a \rcondition that evaluates to 'true'."
