    description: "User tasks are executed by people just like the manual tasks, but\
      \ they are assigned by a process engine, which may, for example, place these\
      \ tasks in each user's task list.\rAfter the human finishes a task, the engine\
      \ expects confirmation, usually including data input or a button click. User\
      \ tasks are part of the Human Workflow Management.\rTypical task examples from\
      \ the world of Human Workflow Management are: Check an invoice; Approve an application\
      \ for vacation; Process a support request."
