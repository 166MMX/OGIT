    description: "Signals are similar to messages, which is why you can model them\
      \ in BPMN as events just as you can with messages. \rThe symbol for a signal\
      \ is a triangle. The essential difference between a signal and a message is\
      \ that that latter \ris always addressed to a specific recipient. (An e-mail\
      \ contains the e-mail address of the recipient, a call starts \rwith dialing\
      \ the telephone number, and so on.) In contrast, a signal is more like a newspaper\
      \ advertisement or a television \rcommercial. It is relatively undirected. Anyone\
      \ who receives the signal and wants to react may do so."
