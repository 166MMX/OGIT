    description: |
      User tasks are executed by people just like the manual tasks, but they are assigned by a process engine, which may, for example, place these tasks in each user's task list.
					After the human finishes a task, the engine expects confirmation, usually including data input or a button click. User tasks are part of the Human Workflow Management.
					Typical task examples from the world of Human Workflow Management are:
					Check an invoice; Approve an application for vacation; Process a support request.
