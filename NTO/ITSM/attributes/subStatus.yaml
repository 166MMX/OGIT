      unlike the other status fields this one allows arbitrary values. It can be used to define status values not allowed by  incidentStatus, changeStatus, ...
      It can also be used to define some other information complementary to the main statsu, e.g. to distinguish between 'Closed successfully' and 'Closed with problems'
