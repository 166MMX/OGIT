    description: |
      Time unit (in seconds) that price applies to. A time unit of 0 for a quantity means a one-time fee is charged. A time 
      unit of 0 for an activity means the price is charged for every instance of the activity. All pricing elements of an 
      attribute pricing must have the same time unit. The time unit is irrelevant for factor pricing elements.
