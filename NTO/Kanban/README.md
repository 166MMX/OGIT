NTO: Kanban
-----

This directory contains the definition of the Kanban NTOs.

Kanban is a new technique for managing a software development process in a highly efficient way. Kanban underpins Toyota's "just-in-time" (JIT) production system. Although producing software is a creative activity and therefore different to mass-producing cars, the underlying mechanism for managing the production line can still be applied.  http://kanbanblog.com/explained/
