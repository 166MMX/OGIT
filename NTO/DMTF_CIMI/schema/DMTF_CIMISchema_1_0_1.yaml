     DMTF CIMI - Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface Schema Vers. 1.0.1\n\n
     
     CIMI addresses the management of the lifecycle of infrastructure provided by a Provider (cloud server). 
     CIMI does not extend beyond infrastructure management to the control of the applications and services that the 
     Consumer (cloud client) chooses to run on the infrastructure provided as a service by the Provider.\n\n
     
     The CIMI Model is documented in Chapter 5 of the CIMI standard (DMTF Paper DSP0263) and consists of 58 resources 
     organized into\n\n

     Cloud Entry Point – the starting point for finding all the other resources as well as the capabilities of this 
     particular cloud\n 
     Machine Resources – resources associated with the compute infrastructure\n 
     Volume Resources – resources associated with the storage infrastructure\n 
     Network Resources – resource associated with the networking infrastructure\n 
     System Resources – the resources related to aggregate relationships of Machines, Volumes and Networks\n 
     Monitoring Resources – the resources associated with metering and eventing of resources\n
