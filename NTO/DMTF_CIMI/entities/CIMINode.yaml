      The scope of the CIMI standard covers core IaaS functionality; it's about deploying and managing Machines, Volumes, 
      Networks, Monitoring, etc. Once you've interfaced to the IaaS provider, the information you need to manage your 
      cloud service can be discovered iteratively, including the metadata describing capabilities and resource 
      constraints. \n\n
      The model behind CIMI describes: resources (systems or collections of resources managed as a whole, probably as 
      an OVF file); machines (a computing resource with CPU and memory); volumes (storage); and networks (representing 
      a layer 2 broadcast domain). It also describes "meters" (metrics for some useful property of something) and event 
      logs.
