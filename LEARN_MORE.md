## What is the Open Graph of IT (OGIT)?

### Summary
The goal of the OGIT (Open Graph of IT) Ontology Framework is to build an open semantic representation of all IT and it's interactions with business process and people for providing a foundation for computational evaluation. The resulting knowledge graph allows to interconnect various IT entities in the IT Operations and IT Management space. While previous approaches like the IBM Common Data Model (CDM) required too much details and did not allow any ambiguity and incorrectness, the Open Graph of IT ontology allows varying levels of detail and can easily consume real world data with all its inaccuracies and redundancies.

The ontology structure is designed for growth both in depth as well as in breadth. It encourages re-use and agreement on best practices but it also leaves room to use data without the need to a priori agree on a common semantics .


### Benefits

Every connected system can store and retrieve information about IT components to and from _GraphIT_ (which is the OGIT implementation). The semantic representation of all information will allow the linking of information from different sources.

### Standards Reference

OGIT re-uses definitions, concepts, and specification from various standards.
Please find a list on [Standards Reference page](../../wiki/Standards-Reference). 

This list will evolve along with OGIT. Feel free to [suggest](CONTRIBUTING.md) any additions to it.
