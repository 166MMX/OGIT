## What is the Open Graph of IT (OGIT)

### Summary
The goal of the OGIT (Open Graph of IT) Ontology Framework is to build an open semantic representation of all IT and it's interactions with business process and people for providing a foundation for computational evaluation. The resulting knowledge graph allows to interconnect various IT Systems in the IT Operations and IT Management space. While previous approaches like the IBM Common Data Model (CDM) required too much details and did not allow any ambiguity and incorrectness, OGIT allows varying levels of details, accepts incorrectness and supports different classes of data to allow proper handling from a computational perspective. The ontology structure is designed for providing a common, best practice approach, thought giving great flexibility and extensibility for every implementor.

### Benefits

Every connected system can store and retrieve information about IT components to and from the OGIT database. The semantic representation of all information will allow the linking of information from different sources.

### Basic Concepts of OGIT

Please have a look at the [Basic Concepts section](../../wiki/Basic-Concepts) for a deeper look at OGIT and the concepts behind it.

Throughout the [Basic Concepts](../../wiki/Basic-Concepts) we used there 'node' and 'connection' in addition to 'entity' and 'verb'. The first two are from graph terminology whereas the latter ones are addressing the semantic aspects of our ontology. The different "languages" are interrelated as follows:


> __entity__: defines the allowed 'node'/'vertex' types in the graph representation. Each 'vertex' in the graph will be an instance of a pre-defined __entity__

> __verb__: defines the allowed 'edge'/'connection' types in the graph representation. Each 'edge' in the graph will be an instance of a pre-defined __verb__
