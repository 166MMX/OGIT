# Welcome to the 'Open Graph for IT' Ontology

# Overview

The strategy of building a semantic representation of all IT and its interaction with business processes and people requires a sound data space as a foundation for computational evaluation of this enterprise space.

Here you'll find an approach we call "OGIT - The Open Graph of IT", which will be the foundation of an 'IT version' of **Google's Knowledge Graph** oder Facebook's **Social Graph**. A specification that every interested party is free to use and to extend utilizing an community-based process.
