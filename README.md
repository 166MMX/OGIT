# Welcome to the _Open Graph of IT_ Ontology

## Overview

_Open Graph of IT_ (OGIT) aims to build a semantic representation of all IT and its interaction with business processes and people.
Such an endeavour requires a sound data space as a foundation for computational evaluation of this enterprise space.
OGIT aims to become the 'IT version' of **Google's Knowledge Graph** or Facebook's **Social Graph**.
Hence we need a common language for IT entities and relationships between them.

OGIT aims to provide a such common language by defining an ontology for the _Graph of IT_.

The OGIT project is not only a hosting place for a specification. It also
provides a platform for domain experts to contribute to the ontology.
One of the basic principles is: _evolution over standardization_.

## GraphIT Documentation

There is an application called [GraphIT](https://graphit.co) that allows you to
manage IT data through a RESTful API ensuring compliance to the OGIT ontology.

The following links provide more information on OGIT and GraphIT.
