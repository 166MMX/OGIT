# Welcome to the 'Open Graph for IT' Ontology

# 1. Overview

The strategy of building a semantic representation of all IT and its interaction with business processes and people requires a sound data space as a foundation for computational evaluation of this enterprise space.

Here you'll find an approach we call "OGIT - The Open Graph of IT", which will be the foundation of an 'IT version' of **Google's Knowledge Graph** oder Facebook's **Social Graph**. A specification that every interested party is free to use and to extend utilizing an community-based process, we will be defining in the near future.

# 2. What is the Open Graph of IT (OGIT)

## Summary
The goal of the OGIT (Open Graph of IT) Ontology Framework is to build an open semantic representation of all IT and it's interactions with business process and people for providing a foundation for computational evaluation. The resulting knowledge graph allows to interconnect various IT Systems in the IT Operations and IT Management space. While previous approaches like the IBM Common Data Model (CDM) required too much details and did not allow any ambiguity and incorrectness, OGIT allows varying levels of details, accepts incorrectness and supports different classes of data to allow proper handling from a computational perspective. The ontology structure is designed for providing a common, best practice approach, thought giving great flexibility and extensibility for every implementor.

## Basic Concepts of OGIT

Please have a look at the [Basic Concepts section](../../wiki/Basic-Concepts) for a deeper look at OGIT and the concepts behind it.

Throughout the [Basic Concepts](../../wiki/Basic-Concepts) we used there 'node' and 'connection' in addition to 'entity' and 'verb'. The first two are from graph terminology whereas the latter ones are addressing the semantic aspects of our ontology. The different "languages" are interrelated as follows:


> __entity__: defines the allowed 'node'/'vertex' types in the graph representation. Each 'vertex' in the graph will be an instance of a pre-defined __entity__

> __verb__: defines the allowed 'edge'/'connection' types in the graph representation. Each 'edge' in the graph will be an instance of a pre-defined __verb__


# 3. Getting started

Please make sure, that you understand the [Basic Concepts section](../../wiki/Basic-Concepts).

## Working with GraphIT

The first part of tutorial covers [how get get data out of GraphIT](../../wiki/Getting-Started-Part-1).
The second one focuses on [creating and connection data in GraphIT](../../wiki/Getting-Started-Part-1).
