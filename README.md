# Welcome to the 'Open Graph for IT' Ontology

# 1. Overview over Contents

Welcome to the Open Graph of IT. The strategy of building a semantic representation of all IT and its interaction with business processes and people requires a sound data space as a foundation for computational evaluation of this enterprise space.

Here you'll find an approach we call "OGIT - The Open Graph of IT", which will be the foundation of an 'IT version' of **Google's Knowledge Graph** oder Facebooks **Social Graph**. A specification that every interested party is free to use and to extend utilizing an community-based process, we will be definig in the near future.

# 2. What is the Open Graph of IT (OGIT)

## Exec Summary
The goal of the OGIT (Open Graph of IT) Ontology Framework is to build an open semantic representation of all IT and it's interactions with business process and people for providing a foundation for computational evaluation. The resulting knowledge graph allows to interconnect various IT Systems in the IT Operations and IT Management space. While previous approaches like the IBM Common Data Model (CDM) required too much
details and did not allow any ambiguity and incorrectness, OGIT allows varying levels of details, accepts incorrectness and supports different classes of data to allow proper handling from a computational perspective. The ontology structure is designed for providing a common, best practice approach, thought giving great flexibility and extensibility for every implementor.
